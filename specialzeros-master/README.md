# Special Zeros â€” Zeros of Special Functions
Matlab functions for the zeros of:
  - Cylinder functions (Linear combinations of Bessel functions), and their derivatives
  - Bessel function cross-products 
  
Functions are fast (1e5 of roots per second on modern pc) and accurate
(typically relative error of 1e-16).
